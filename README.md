# Luna3_orbiter_addon
Add-on of the Luna 3 probe for the Orbiter space flight simulator.


This project is in a very alpha state, and will be improved over time. As I learn more how to program. So let's cross our fingers and hope it works...

## TODO:

Add RCS features (engines, contrails, etc.).


Animate the antennas (as soon as I find out more about how they worked in real life).


Improve textures and mesh.


Make a version for Orbiter Windows.


Whichever happens first...
